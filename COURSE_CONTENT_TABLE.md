### 1.1 Introduction to Computer Vision

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---- |
| Recognition | This refers to the process of attaching **_semantic_ category labels** to objects, scenes, events, and activities in images. [\[1\]][1] |
| Reconstruction | Traditionally, this involves the **recovery of three-dimensional geometry** from images.<br>More broadly, it can be interpreted as **"inverse graphics"**: estimating shape, spatial layout, reflectance, and illumination. [\[1\]][1] |
| Reorganization | This refers to the **grouping/segmentation** of visual elements.<br>It is the computer vision analog of _perceptual organization_ from Gestalt psychology. [\[1\]][1] |

### 1.2 What is an Image?

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---- |
| Signal | A signal is a **function** of some variable(s), often time or space.<br>Its inputs and outputs typically have physical meaning &mdash; for instance, an image can be understood as a signal: brightness as a function of position. |
| Quantization | This is the process of mapping values from a **larger, continuous, and/or infinite set** to values in a **smaller, discrete, and/or finite set**.<br>It is the basis of discrete signal and image processing. |
| Resolution | For our purposes ([slide 18](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15rw06o8WOnqjfQMjPjdSkrHJ1Qhn-4R9/view)):<br>**Spatial resolution** refers to the linear spacing of a measurement, which, in the context of images, corresponds to the physical separation represented by a pixel &mdash; this could be an angle or a distance.<br>**Geometric resolution** is closer in meaning to [angular resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_resolution), which relates to [resolving power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_resolution#Definition_of_terms), the Rayleigh criterion, and how "blurry" images are. |

### 2.1 Image Filtering

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---- |
| Filter | As generally as possible, a filter is a **function of the local neighborhood** which operates on a signal.<br>This function can be continuous or discrete, linear or non-linear, ... etc, and the "local neighborhood" can even be infinite in extent. |
| Image Filtering | It is the computation of a **function of the local neighborhood** of an image **at each position**.<br>We use filtering to enhance, extract information from, and detect patterns in images. |
| Convolution | As generally as possible, convolution is an **operation** which takes two functions and produces a third function whose value at some point X is the _integral_ of the _product_ of the first function and the second function _flipped in the x direction then offset by X_. Whew!<br><br>This is relevant to us because the convolution of a given **image** and **filter** is the result of **image filtering**!<br>Note: In the context of digital image processing, _integrals_ are just sums over matrix elements, _products_ are Hadamard products, and _flipping_ is just rotating by 180Â°.<br><br>`Todo: check if this is a necessary and sufficient explanation` |
| Correlation | Correlation is the same as convolution, but without the flipping: if you can do one, you can do the other, simply by doing the flipping yourself.<br>**_Correlation is not commutative, but convolution is_**. |
| Kernel | In the context of digital image processing, a kernel is a **2D matrix** which acts as a (linear) filter when **convolved** with another 2D matrix, typically an image. |
| Separability | When used to describe a kernel, separability refers to the kernel's ability to be **factored out** as the **product of two 1D kernels** (one row and one column vector).<br>Given a separable kernel `K` which factors out into `R` and `C`, and an image `I`:<br>`K * I == R * (C * I) == C * (R * I)`, where `*` represents the convolution operator. |
| Linearity | When used to describe a kernel, linearity refers to... `Todo` |
| Correlation and Convolution | `Todo` |
